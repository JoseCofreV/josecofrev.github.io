<center><p>Juana Fernández Solar; Santiago de Chile, 1900 - Los Andes, 1920) Young nun who was the first Chilean saint of the Catholic Church. From a very young age she had shown signs of her spirituality: she wanted to receive Communion when she was only five years old, she promised at six to say the rosary every day and at fourteen she sponsored a child who had asked her for alms on the street. Reading the work Historia de un alma, by the French Carmelite Teresita del Niño Jesús and, above all, the works of Saint Teresa of Jesus, whom she considered her guide and teacher, greatly influenced the development of her vocation.</p>
	<p>On May 7, 1919, she entered the Carmelites of Los Andes and was renamed Teresa de Jesús, although she would later be known as Teresa de Los Andes. Six months later, she began her novitiate by taking the Carmelite habit. During her stay in the convent she did not stop writing letters to her family and friends in which she proclaimed her love for Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Eucharist, as well as
more of his joy and happiness to see his vocation fulfilled: "this is how we spend our lives; praying, working and laughing".</p>
<p>Throughout his short life he suffered from various illnesses, including diphtheria and typhus. From the age of 11 to 15, he suffered health problems every December 8, being in danger of death several times. He never expressed, however, the slightest complaint, since he considered that it was God who "allowed him to suffer." In 1918 Juana had asked her confessor: "what I want to know is where do you think I will sanctify myself sooner, because as I have told you several times, my Lord has given me to understand that I would live very little". In 1920 she fell seriously ill as a result of typhus, and in death article she received the habits as Sister Teresa of Jesus. After an agony of 14 days, she died in the convent on April 12, 1920.</p></center><p>ﾠ</p>

<p>Luis Alberto Miguel Hurtado Cruchaga was born in Viña del Mar, into an impoverished aristocratic family. When he was four years old, his father died, leaving Alberto and his younger brother in the care of his mother, together with whom they moved to Santiago, to the house of some uncles.
Around 1941, Alberto Hurtado was named Archdiocesan Advisor to the Catholic Youth. The special characteristics of his personality made him an influential model for the youth of the time, to whom he directed various works, among which are: Message to the youth and Influence of the Media on Youth. He was the founder and first director of the Mensaje magazine.</p>
<p>Together with youth and blue-collar workers, their cause turned to the harshest extreme of poverty: homelessness. He himself repeated: "Ending misery is impossible, but fighting against it is a sacred duty." To this day, many remember him touring the streets with his green truck, picking up homeless children, adults, and the elderly. It was this work that gave rise to the Hogar de Cristo, consisting of hospederías and homes for children and the elderly throughout the country, and which constitute the work that has given Father Alberto Hurtado the greatest renown and one of the main milestones in his biography.</p>
<p>His early death in 1952 from cancer caused the sorrow of many Chileans who to this day remember his life and work with affection and devotion.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1994, an event long awaited by all the followers of Father Hurtado took place; He was beatified by Pope John Paul II. On October 23, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI canonized Father Alberto Hurtado, declaring him a saint of the Catholic Church.</p>
