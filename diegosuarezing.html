	<center><h1>Chilesaurus diegosuarezi</h1>

	<p><h4>Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is the only known species of the extinct genus Chilesaurus of dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic,<br>
	 150-146 million years ago in what is now South America. Its fossils were discovered in the Aysén region of Chile. At the time of its description,<br>
	  it was considered one of the few known herbivorous theropods outside of coelurosaurs. It has an unusual combination of theropod, ornithischian,<br>
	   and sauropodomorph traits. , so this genus has important implications for the understanding of dinosaur evolution, such as the traditional division<br>
	    between saurischians-ornithischians or as support for the alternative proposal of the Ornithoscelida group. According to the fossils found<br>
	     in the Toqui Formation, Chilesaurus it coexisted with other small theropods, basal crocodyliforms, and both diplodocid<br>
	      and titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs.</h4></p>

	     <h2>Description</h2>
             <p><h4>Chilesaurus measured about 3.2 meters from nose to tail. The small head has small, spatula-shaped<br>
              pointing teeth obliquely forward. This dentition, unique to theropods, is typical of a herbivore, indicating<br>
               that Chilesaurus fed on plants,
        a very unusual adaptation in theropods, since most were carnivorous.</p>
